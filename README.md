## Designing and Developing the 3D Scene

Starting off, I approach software design like sketching before a full-blown painting. This project was a deep dive into textures and lighting, making my 3D world come alive in ways I hadn't imagined before.

### Design Process

- **Imagining the Scene**: It all began with a vision of what I wanted to create. Picking out objects, deciding on lighting effects, and sketching out the plan.
- **Building Piece by Piece**: I tackled the development by breaking it down - focusing on smaller parts, adjusting based on what looked good, and iterating a ton.
- **Evolving My Code**: My coding approach got a serious upgrade. Starting simple, I eventually managed to work in some pretty advanced OpenGL features.

### Lessons Learned and Looking Forward

- **Why It Matters**: Reflecting on this project, I realize how each step taught me something new, kind of like leveling up in a game.
- **Beyond the Project**: This wasn't just about crafting a cool 3D scene. It's about the broader scope of using computer science to create, whether it's games, simulations, or something entirely new.
- **Future Pathways**: On the educational front, this project has really expanded my view of what's possible with programming. Professionally, I'm excited about the potential opportunities in tech and gaming where creativity and code collide.

## Wrapping Up

This project was both challenging and incredibly rewarding. It's not just a piece of my portfolio; it's a testament to tackling complex challenges and pushing my limits. I'm eager to see where these new skills take me in the world of computer science and graphics.
